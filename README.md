My API Can be Observed Here: https://mrterranova.github.io/gifAPI/

### Overview

In this assignment, you'll use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice. To finish this task, you must call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of your site.

### Instructions

1. Before you can make any part of your site work, you need to create an array of strings, each one related to a topic that interests you. Save it to a variable called `topics`.

   * Choose a theme: This one will be a secret until user can access it.

2. This app takes the topics in this array and create buttons in the HTML.

3. When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

4. When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif becomes animated. If the user clicks the gif again, it will stop playing.

5. Under every gif, display its rating (PG, G, so on).
   * This data is provided by the GIPHY API.
   * Only once you get images displaying with button presses should you move on to the next step.

6. There is a form that takes a value from a user input box and adds it to the `topics` array. Then make a function call that takes each topic in the array and remakes the buttons on the page.
